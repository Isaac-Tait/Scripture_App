            <h1>A unique Bible reading plan</h1>
            <p>Originally conceived by Professor Grant Horner in the 1980's this Bible reading system has stood the test of time.</p>
            <p>Each and every day you will read ten (10) chapters of the Bible.</p>
            <p>Begin by clicking <a href="index1.html">here</a> and then proceed through each of the other readings, picking off where you left off the day before.</p>
            <p>If you have completed a List a button will appear that will allow you to reset your progress.</p>
            <p>Some parts of the Bible (List 7 & 10) you will read 12+ times in one year. Other parts (List 9 for example) you will only read through once in a calendar year.</p>
            <p>It may seem daunting at first but stick with it for one month and you will see the profound affect this Scripture study program has on your retention and spiritual life.</p>
            <p>At first it may take an hour to get through all ten chapters but just make sure you are reading the Scripture and not diving into the notes or cross references and after a few weeks you should see your time engaged in reading begin to taper off.</p>
            <br />
            <p>So what are you waiting for!? Let us begin...</p>
