# Scripture_App
Two years ago I was searching for a Bible reading plan that was a little more involved then just reading the whole Bible once in a year. 
Then I discovered Professor Grant Horners plan [1]. At first sight I knew it was what I was looking for. I followed the plan for about 18 months 
and it profoundly impacted me. My goal is to make this plan globably available through the web and so I set out to build this app.

Quickly though the project began to grow beyond the scope of my limited knowledge. As of February 2020 I have only been learning Full Stack Web Development 
for 11 months. So, I decided to make the project open source and see if I could get some help a long the way. 

I have created a Project for the app with an extensive list of issues to choose from. If you have any questions feel free to reach out to me at either:
